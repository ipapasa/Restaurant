# Restaurant

Hello. This is an example app using the following techniques:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Angular.js
* For authentication, it uses [Passport-Local-Mongoose](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose)
* For testing, it uses [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)
* For environment variables it uses [dotenv-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-node)
* In Angular, the [ui router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) is used over ng-route.
* The wonderful template is the free bootstrap theme from [Stanley](http://www.blacktie.co/demo/stanley/).
